### Example

This example adds two buttons to the toolbar:

{% include codepen.html id="custom-toolbar-button" tab="js" %}

### Explanation

This example adds two buttons to the toolbar. The first just inserts "It's my button!" into the editor when clicked.
â€‹
The second button is an example of how onSetup works. This button inserts a `time` element containing the current date into the editor using a `toTimeHtml()` helper function - a simplified version of TinyMCE's [insertdatetime]({{site.baseurl}}/plugins/insertdatetime/) plugin.

Since it wouldn't make sense to insert a `time` element into another `time` element, we have used `onSetup` to listen to the editor's [`NodeChange` event]({{site.baseurl}}/advanced/events/#nodechange) and disable the button when the user's cursor is inside a `time` element (or "node"). We have also borrowed an icon from the `insertdatetime` plugin, and explicitly set `disabled` to `true` in the button configuration so that it is disabled when the button is created.

`onSetup` is a complex property. It requires a function that takes the button's API and returns a function that takes the button's API and returns nothing. That's because `onSetup` is run whenever its toolbar button is created, and the function it returns must be a callback for when the button is destroyed - essentially an `onTeardown` handler.

When you listen to events in `onSetup` using `editor.on(eventName, callback)`, you're binding a callback function to an event. Therefore, in the teardown handler you need to tell the editor which function to unbind from which event using `editor.off(eventName, callback)`.

> Note:

* The callback function is the same one you passed to `editor.on()`. In this case, because we're binding the `editorEventCallback` function to the `NodeChange` event when the button is created, we simply need to return `(api) => editor.off('NodeChange', editorEventCallback)`.
* If you don't listen to any editor events or only listen to the editor's `init` event, you can just return an empty function from onSetup - `return () => {};`.
