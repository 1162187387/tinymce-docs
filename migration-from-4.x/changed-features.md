Each release of TinyMCE adds new features and functionality. We also occasionally remove features and functionality, usually because we've added a better option.
Here are the details about the features and functionalities that we removed in TinyMCE 5.0.

## Removed Features

### Listbox

**Listbox** is no longer a supported toolbar button type in TinyMCE 5.0. Though listbox has been removed, any functionality provided by custom listbox toolbar buttons can be retained by switching to a different type of toolbar button.
Any custom listbox toolbar buttons can be converted to a different type of toolbar button using the new API. The recommended toolbar button type to switch to is **Split** button.


## Removed Themes

### Inlite

The Inlite theme is no longer supported in TinyMCE 5.0. The features that the Inlite theme used to provide is now available as a plugin. For a workaround, using the following configuration:
```
{
  theme: 'silver',
  inline: true,
  toolbar: false,
  plugins: [ 'inlite' ]
}
 ```
This will provide a similar and improved distraction free experience in TinyMCE 5.0.

### Modern

The Modern theme is no longer supported in TinyMCE 5.  The modern themes Ui library `tinymce.ui.*` has also been deleted. This change may impact integrations depending upon the level of customization.

For changes required, refer to the following table:

| Customization Level | Description | Impact |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ------ |
| Minor | Some custom buttons | no Ui fixes required, update `addButton` configuration to TinyMCE 5.0 format |
| Moderate | A dialog created using `editor.windowManager.open` configuration objects | Convert TinyMCE 4 config to TinyMCE 5 config |
| Major | Completely custom dialogs and extended use of the Modern UI framework | Not all API use cases are covered by our new TinyMCE 5 components. However, we will strive to create supported workarounds or if there are sufficient requests, we a new component to resolve the use case. |

> Note: Please provide feedback on your use case and your Tinymce 4.x configuration containing only the UI component that you wish to be supported or need a workaround.

> Note: The Silver theme in TinyMCE 5.0 contains a set of configurable UI components that could be used to replace the current customizations (modern, inline, and inlite theme). Silver is enabled by default. If you do not specify a theme, it will default to Silver.


## Changed Features

### Dialog

Plugins that use dialogs as their UI, no longer have `height` or `width` properties. The dialog component now uses a predefined `normal`, `medium`, and `large` template to specify the dimensions. 

#### Differences from 4.x to 5.0

The following plugins from Tiny 4.x do not require height or width options to be specified in Tiny 5.0:

* [Code]({{site.baseurl}}/plugins/code/)
* [Codesample]({{site.baseurl}}plugins/codesample/)
* [Preview]({{site.baseurl}}plugins/preview/)
* [Template]({{site.baseurl}}plugins/template/)

Please read the [docs]({{site.baseurl}}/plugins/) if you need more information on the Tiny 4.x configuration options.


### Table

* Styles text field has been removed from the advanced table of the dialogs. This simplifies the dialogs for users and gives the editor stricter control over the table styles which means we are better able to ensure the styles are correct.
* Improved how styles are set and retrieved from tables, rows, and cells, so this should be more reliable now.
* Shifted to using CSS more for styling, and therefore removed a few legacy data attributes that were set on tables/rows/cells which are no longer the good practice to use. This makes the output HTML cleaner and more modern.
* When opening a properties dialog with a single table/row/cell selected, the dialog will autofill with the relevant existing values. If you select multiple rows or cells and open the relevant properties dialog, TinyMCE 4 will leave all the dialog fields blank. In TinyMCE 5, any fields which have the same values for all the selected rows or cells will autofill, and the fields which have no existing value or have differing values will be empty.
* `Border` input field in the `tableprops` dialog is now called `Border width`, for better clarity.

### Context Menu

The context menu is no longer a plugin, it is part of the core and always enabled. Where TinyMCE 4 only supported adding registered menu items, the new context menu allows plugins to register "sections" of the context menu. These sections are dynamic and may show or hide depending on the cursor position when the context menu is opened.

The `contextmenu` configuration can include menu items as before, but now also plugin menu sections. For example, the default context menu config is now `'link image editimage table spelling'` which are all plugin section references, not menu items.

For more information on Context Menus, see the [docs]({{site.baseurl}}/components/contextmenu).


### Context Toolbar

The Context Toolbar takes its buttons from things that are registered with as toolbar buttons using `addButton`, `addToggleButton`, `addSplitButton` or `addMenuButton`. For more information on Context Toolbars, see [docs]({{site.baseurl}}/components/contexttoolbar).

The method for creating custom context toolbars has also been moved from `editor.addContextToolbar()` to `editor.ui.registry.addContextToolbar()`.

### Context Form

ContextForms are a generalisation of the `Insert Link` form that existed in the original `inlite` plugin from [TinyMCE 4]((https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/themes/inlite/#quicklink)).

### Toolbar buttons

1. SVG icons for a better crisp look.
2. Buttons are now added via methods in `editor.ui.registry` rather than `editor` e.g. `editor.ui.registry.addButton()` instead of `editor.addButton()`
3. New methods were added for split, toggle and menu toolbar buttons with configuration options specific to the button type, to make the creation of custom toolbar buttons easier.

### Custom Menu Items // TODO explanations of the subpoints

* editor.menuitems

### Custom Sidebars // TODO explanation

* editor.addSidebar

### Toolbar Menus

* New buttons are added to the global `editor.settings.menus` which is an enhancement since, it now shows the toggled state.
* Improved mouse and keyboard navigation.
