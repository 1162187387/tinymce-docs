## Known Issue

### Mobile

Tiny 5.0 has changed significantly from TinyMCE 4.x. The Mobile theme might require some configuration changes depending on your customization. This is a known issue and we are working on providing a stable solution for that. Please provide feedback on your use case, and your current Tinymce 4.x configuration file containing only the UI component that you wish to be supported or to know a work around.
